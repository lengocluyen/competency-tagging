A graph is defined as a set of vertices and a set of edges that pair these vertices. If no multiple edges or loops are allowed, the graph is called a simple graph. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it. A complete graph on n vertices has an edge between every pair of vertices, whereas an empty graph has no edges. Cycles are closed paths that begin and end at the same vertex without repeating edges, and line graphs represent edges of an original graph as vertices in a new graph. These ideas form the foundation for more advanced topics such as paths, connectivity and special classes of graphs.", "token_count": 124}

If you choose a cupcake frosting, filling and topping, the total number of cupcakes you can make is the product of the number of options for each component. This rule can be extended to more complex situations such as counting lottery combinations or card hands by treating each selection as a stage and multiplying the available choices. Because repeating items is often not allowed, factorial expressions help simplify calculations.", "token_count": 97}

The section uses maps of Earth drawn on flat and spherical surfaces to illustrate that different representations can be isomorphic.

Heuristics are useful when there is too much information, little time or insufficient data. Working backwards is a heuristic where you start from the desired goal and plan backwards. Breaking large tasks into smaller steps is another heuristic that makes complex tasks more manageable.

The combinations section notes that permutations count subsets when order matters, while combinations count when order does not. The tree diagrams section explains that experiments have sample spaces containing all possible outcomes; tables and tree diagrams organize and visualize these spaces. The probability section distinguishes theoretical, empirical and subjective probabilities and explains how to compute complements. Probability with permutations and combinations uses counting techniques to find probabilities when the sample space is large. The odds section defines odds as the ratio of the probability of an event to that of its complement. Later sections introduce the addition rule for probability, conditional probability, the binomial distribution and expected value, which concerns the long‑term average outcome of repeated experiments.", "token_count": 160}
