Linear programming is a mathematical technique to solve problems involving finding maximums or minimums where a linear function is limited by various constraints. The field began in the late 1930s and early 1940s and was used during World War II to maximize troop effectiveness and minimize casualties. Businesses later adopted linear programming to maximize output and minimize expenses; in short, it is a method for solving problems that involve finding a maximum or minimum where a linear function is constrained by various factors.", "extraction_method": "html", "text_hash": "e168c1af25f7b1fae6fa3e4d55ff258e", "notes": ""}
