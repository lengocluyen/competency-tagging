From an accounting perspective, companies use controls to reduce the risk that what they planned to happen during the budgeting and planning processes will not happen. A risk management plan identifies potential risks and describes controls for each. Common examples include budgeting errors that lead to excess or insufficient production; implementing a rigorous review of the budgeting process and periodic reviews during the budget term helps reduce this risk. Inaccurate reporting of inventory valuation can be addressed by performing periodic physical inventory counts and comparing them to the financial accounting records. Managers should consider the broader consequences of budget decisions. For example, moving production overseas might lower costs on paper but could reduce product quality, increase lead times, and harm employee morale. Decisions also affect company reputation; a firm known for domestic production might alienate customers by relocating manufacturing. Effective risk management requires looking beyond immediate financial costs to assess all potential risks, including legal and ethical considerations.", "token_count": 173}

Its main goals are confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality ensures that people cannot acquire information they should not; integrity ensures that data cannot be changed by unauthorized individuals; and availability ensures that legitimate users cannot be prevented from using the computer. Security often tells computers what not to do, making it unique compared to most programming. Basic security methods include limiting access to safe users, using peripherals that block unsafe activity, and installing firewall and antivirus software. The page also introduces malware, short for malicious software, which can be installed without the owner’s approval. Malware includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. These programs can steal passwords, delete files, collect personal information, or stop a computer from working. Security software helps prevent malware installation, but removing malware can be difficult even with specialized programs. The history section notes that malware began in the 1970s and early 1980s as a curiosity and grew rapidly with increased computer use in the late 1990s and early 2000s.", "token_count": 176}

Modern operating systems provide access to resources via the kernel, but must distinguish between requests that should be allowed and those that should not. Requester identity is established through authentication, often a username and password, though magnetic cards or biometric data may also be used. Once authenticated, authorization determines which services and resources the user can access. In addition to controlling access, secure systems offer auditing options to track who has been reading or modifying files. Internal security requires all potentially harmful requests to be carried out through operating system calls; if programs can directly access hardware, they cannot be secured. External security handles login attempts and network connections, often using device drivers to pass requests to the kernel. The Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) set standards for assessing operating system security, influencing how systems are designed to handle sensitive or classified information. At the network level, hardware devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection or prevention systems defend against compromised services. Software firewalls are often enabled by default and can be configured to allow or deny network traffic to or from specific services. Thus, even insecure services like Telnet can be isolated by blocking traffic to the relevant port.", "token_count": 210}

Losing important data due to hardware failure or deleting critical files can be devastating. Companies must protect computers, networks, and stored or transmitted information from threats such as security breaches, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, keyloggers, and human error. Disasters like fires, earthquakes, or floods, as well as power outages and equipment failure, require fault-tolerant systems and disaster plans. Unauthorized access—whether from internal employees or external hackers—is a major concern, and nearly all U.S. businesses report at least one security issue. Modern cybercriminals operate professionally and may install keylogging software via email attachments or drive‑by downloads. Viruses replicate by attaching to host programs and can destroy data, worms spread automatically through networks, and Trojan horses trick users into installing malicious software. Spam poses a threat by spreading malware through email attachments and causing lost productivity. Deliberate acts of sabotage, such as a disgruntled employee deleting records, highlight the need for backups and comprehensive security policies.", "token_count": 167}

Information security aims to protect data from unauthorized access or tampering, while information privacy concerns individuals’ control over their personal data. Although related, security and privacy address different aspects: security is about guarding the perimeter using tools such as encryption, firewalls, and secure network design, whereas privacy is about managing who has access to personal data. Both are essential for safeguarding digital assets. The section introduces the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad—a foundational model in cybersecurity that balances keeping data secure and ensuring authorized users can access it. Confidentiality aims to keep sensitive information in the right hands and involves encryption and access controls. Integrity preserves the fidelity of data over its life cycle using hashing and digital signatures. Availability ensures that services and data are accessible to authorized users by preventing disruptions such as denial‑of‑service attacks. The discussion emphasizes that practitioners must continuously update their knowledge of new technologies, laws, and best practices to maintain a secure and private digital environment.", "token_count": 179}

Firewalls serve as gatekeepers that police data flows and prevent cyber threats. Modern firewalls examine packet headers and, in the case of stateful inspection or next‑generation firewalls, analyze connection contexts and integrate intrusion detection and prevention systems. Proxy firewalls act as intermediaries between users and web services, providing isolation and security. The section notes that configuring security policies can be complex and that regular updates are essential to handle new threats.

Core components include risk assessment, policy development, control implementation, training and awareness, monitoring and auditing, and response and recovery. Risk assessment identifies potential threats and vulnerabilities and evaluates their impact on assets. Policy development formalizes guidelines to dictate how assets should be protected and managed. Controls can be administrative, technical, or physical, and their effectiveness must be reviewed regularly. Training and awareness programs cultivate a culture of security, recognizing that employees are often the first line of defense. Continuous monitoring and auditing ensure visibility into the organization’s security posture, while a well‑crafted response and recovery plan defines how to identify, investigate, contain, and remediate security incidents.", "token_count": 161}

Compromised IoT data can lead to significant privacy breaches. The Internet of Things (IoT) connects everyday objects—from refrigerators and thermostats to locks and bulbs—into a network that shares data with other devices and cloud services. The number of IoT devices has grown rapidly, from around 500 million in 2003 to over 10 billion in 2018, and is expected to reach 40 billion by 2030. While IoT creates opportunities for innovation and efficiency, it also introduces major security vulnerabilities. In the workplace, IoT devices may enable attackers to eavesdrop, conduct brute‑force attacks, and elevate privileges on a network. The section notes that regulation is challenging because devices are manufactured, sold, and operated across different jurisdictions. Manufacturers often prioritize time to market over security, leading to devices with hard‑to‑patch vulnerabilities. Examples such as the Mirai botnet attack show how default passwords and unsecured services can be exploited to launch massive distributed denial‑of‑service (DDoS) attacks. As IoT proliferates, regulators and enterprises must commit to transparency, accountability, and privacy protection to address the inherent vulnerabilities of web and IoT technologies.", "token_count": 187}

Audits evaluate actions an organization takes in each area, such as reevaluating user consent mechanisms, scrutinizing third‑party app policies, and improving data minimization.
