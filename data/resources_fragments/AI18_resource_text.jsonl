Divide up into pairs for this activity.\nPrototype Your Alarm Clock\nThink about the alarm clock you use to wake up every day. It may be a digital clock radio, it may be an analog clock, it may even be a cellphone or a desktop application. Make a low-fidelity prototype of your alarm clock. Include enough of the interface so that your low-fi prototype can display and change the current time, display and change the alarm time, and turn the alarm on and off. Each of you should draw your own alarm clock at the same time. Don\u2019t discuss it with your partner yet.\nRun Your Prototype\nSimulate your prototype, acting as the Computer, while your partner acts as user. Use these tasks: Is the alarm set to wake me up at 9 am? Suppose not. Set the alarm to wake me up at 9 am. Set the current time one hour backward for a daylight savings time switch. Then switch roles, so that the other person acts as the Computer simulating their own prototype on you.", "extraction_method": "html", "text_hash": "852e26f0e552d0bca76941441522856b79a079bb5716808dc73472906331f14e", "notes": ""}

You will need to look at LongRun.java, which is the Java code you\u2019ll be using. It\u2019s compiled into LongRun.jar.\nLong Task in Event Handler: Run the Java program. You\u2019ll see a counter, initially at 0. The job of the long task is to increment this counter by 1000 units (and simulating computation or I/O by spending about 1 millisecond to do each increment). So the correct behavior is that you should see the counter rapidly increase from 0 to 1000. Press the Event Handler button. What actually happens? Look at the code. Why does it have the effect you saw?\nLong Task in Thread: Now click the Thread button, and examine the corresponding code. What happens? Now click the Thread button several times quickly, so that several threads are running at the same time. After all the threads are done, you\u2019d expect to see the counter increase by some multiple of 1000. What actually happens? Why?\nUsing invokeLater(): Now load LongRun.java into Eclipse or an editor, and modify the code for the UsingInvokeLater button so that it calls SwingUtilities.invokeLater() to avoid the problem you saw with the Thread button. There\u2019s an example of the syntax for invokeLater() elsewhere in the program. Click the UsingInvokeLater button a few times quickly to make sure you fixed it, and make sure the counter still increases steadily over time instead of skipping straight to its final value.\nUsing Timers: Now implement the body of the UsingTimer button so that it uses javax.swing.Timer to do the work in the background.", "extraction_method": "html", "text_hash": "648775490a421ccae8b350f5a11372a38ee772cceb9d8b7465467a22a02b609d", "notes": ""}

You\u2019ll need a modern standards-compliant web browser like Firefox, Opera, or Safari; don\u2019t use an old version of Internet Explorer. The exercises use an in-browser JavaScript environment (Event Workbench).\nEvent Dispatch and Propagation: The workbench is initially configured with an event listener listening for clicks on A. Which objects can you click on to fire this listener? Add a click listener to object C (keeping the listener on A as well). Which listeners fire when you click on C? In what order do they fire? How about when you click on B? Change your listener on C so that it consumes the event by calling event.stopPropagation(). Now which listeners fire when you click on C? How about when you click on B? Finally, change your listener for A from a bubbling-phase listener to a capturing listener. Now which listeners fire when you click on C and in what order?\nEvent Translation: JavaScript\u2019s events for mouse clicking are click, mousedown, mouseup, and dblclick. Attach listeners for these events to one of the objects in the workbench to discover the sequence in which these events occur when the user double-clicks on that object. Which of these events are raw, and which are translated?\nMouse Movements: JavaScript\u2019s event for mouse movement is mousemove. Add a mouse move listener to A, and display the mouse coordinates using print(event.clientX + \u201c,\u201d + event.clientY). What origin are these (x,y) positions using?

First, use the squint test to look at the whole page. What parts of the design stand out clearly? Now look closely at the individual search results. Each result consists of several data fields. How is each data field displayed using visual variables? For example, the page-title field uses three variables: hue: blue, size: large font, position: first line of result. Write your findings on a whiteboard.\nContrast: Now go to the Drudge Report. Use the squint test to look at the whole page. What parts of the design stand out clearly? What are the major sections of the Drudge Report, and how might you use visual variables to improve their contrast?\nAlignment: Go to Google Advanced Image Search. How are the form controls aligned vertically? It may help to resize the window so you can watch how the controls move around. What alignment compromises were made, and why?

Are these colors used for parts of the page that should attract notice? Evaluate it for color-blind users. Use VisCheck to look at the web page as a deuteranope would see it.
