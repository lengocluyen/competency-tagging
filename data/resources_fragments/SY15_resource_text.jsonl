Humans and animals move aggressively by executing motions that lose instantaneous control authority. Controlling nonlinear systems without complete control authority requires methods that exploit the natural dynamics of machines. This course discusses nonlinear dynamics and control of underactuated mechanical systems, emphasizing machine learning methods. Topics include nonlinear dynamics of passive robots (walkers, swimmers, flyers), motion planning, partial feedback linearization, energy-shaping control, analytical optimal control, reinforcement learning/approximate optimal control, and the influence of mechanical design on control. Examples from biology include legged locomotion, compliant manipulation, underwater robots, and flying machines.", "extraction_method": "html", "text_hash": "cea6fbc15c9195b0c182aadca943ea35c78aa6fc9fa3c86513cc39feb58a79dc", "notes": ""}
