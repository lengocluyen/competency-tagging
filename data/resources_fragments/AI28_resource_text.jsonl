In its early days data collection, management and analysis were carried out by separate experts in the domain, computer science and statistics.  Technological advances have blurred these boundaries; modern data scientists need expertise across all three domains.  The section introduces the data science cycle – problem definition, data collection, data preparation, analysis and reporting – and notes that data collection and cleaning often consume as much as half the project effort.  Everyday devices like smartphones generate huge quantities of data, and a data scientist or team must design workflows to harness these data ethically and effectively.  The section emphasises that the data science process is iterative and that clear problem definition and careful preparation lay the groundwork for successful analysis and reporting.", "extraction_method": "html", "text_hash": "771d5b5966b531bde370a02f3b13b934e03669b88b164d4099e39a69f38549ee", "notes": ""}
