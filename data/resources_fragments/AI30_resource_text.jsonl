Each process has its own address space and executes concurrently with others. Concurrency occurs when multiple processes are in progress at the same time, requiring the operating system to manage resources and coordinate their interactions. Operating systems provide mechanisms such as process scheduling, inter‑process communication and threads to enable concurrency. Threads are lightweight processes that share the same address space but can run independently. Concurrency can increase system throughput and resource utilisation, but it introduces challenges like synchronization, data races and deadlock, which must be handled by careful design of software and operating systems【614508547114889†L30-L56】.", "extraction_method": "html", "text_hash": "5174a2df9b931cd26cb956f76b28e5f7", "notes": ""}
