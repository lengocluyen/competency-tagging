The class project has two tasks: controlling a 5‑degree‑of‑freedom robot manipulator to perform pick‑and‑place tasks with objects moved from initial to target poses using MATLAB simulations, and using a vision system to enable an autonomous robotic arm to pick colored objects and place them in different poses based on their colors. Course results showed that high‑level deployment of robot platforms in interactive project‑based learning increased student performance, with 100% success in the first task and 75% success in the second task.
